# SpringMVCModelAttribDataBinding
This is a demo project which uses @ModelAttribute annotation for binding of form attributes to the model object with the help of a bean
class that complies with the form attributes and this is done without taking help of the HttpServletRequest object to fetch the data 
submitted by the user.
